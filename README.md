# TWRP for Alldocube M8

3.3.1-0 - Ready to use, Android 8-11

Tested on my Alldocube M8, T806K modification. 

Fully functional:
- Backup/restore
- Flash any zip/img you want
- Tap-to-wake
- Mount/umount partitions
- ext2/3/4/fat/exfat (f2fs removed due to incompatibility)
- Google Sans
- Format, resize and repair partitions

All work, seriously. Flash and use!
